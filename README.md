# Clock Adjustable for Adjusting Sampling Rate
This repository was created to contain mini-project: **Clock Adjustable for Adjusting Sampling Rate**. This mini-project is been a part of studying Introduction to Signals and Systems.

## Description
This mini-project is systhesised by VHDL with Quartus Prime Lite 20.1 Edition on FPGA DE0-Nano. We are studying about what's happen to the output signal if we adjust i2c bus speed. 
There are 2 communication protocals.
- SPI (FPGA-ADC)
- I2C (FPGA-DAC)

## Components
- FPGA DE0-Nano
-  MCP4725 I2C DAC Module
